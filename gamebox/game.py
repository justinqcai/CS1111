# Checkpoint 1

# Here we have a side-scroll type game, where it has hints from multiple different games. We already designed a majority
# of the game as seen below, it all should work on any computer except for the music (going to figure out how to
# upload that to be used externally but we'll see if that's possible. The premise of the game is a character has levels,
# experience, and a weapon to go through different rooms. The first room is what we have so farâ€”a woods-type room, with
# the skeleton as the enemy. Every kill is 10 exp, 50 exp to level up, and each room is 3 levels. 1-3 is woods, 3-6 is
# TBD, 6-9 is TBD, and 10 is a boss that will award 50 exp and will cause an end-game win (like Bowser, if you want
# to relate this to mario. So far we have user input (up arrow, right arrow, left arrow, space, and will soon have e
# for equipment [potions, maybe?]). Graphics are seen. Start screen is implemented but hidden until we finish the
# entirety of the game. "Small enough window" is used. As for optional features, we implemented a multitude of
# animations, we will have different (moving) enemies that will hit and can be hit. Collectibles we will have but have
# not determined, possibly potions for health or coins for extra exp. The level scrolls. We might implement a timer
# so as that you must finish each room in time. Health meter is implemented. There will be multiple levels. We might
# do a save point, but we have to discuss that and debate on whether it is useful. Not sure if anything we've done
# so far constitutes as "something more" but we've got a pretty robust code thus far.

# Checkpoint 2

# I finally got to speak to Luther today, he explained to me how to fix the few bugs we have. We couldn't figure out
# how to physically hit the monsters from a distance, fix their flip() movement, and fix the animations
# (pressing one button to go through an entire animation). As of now those are our only bugs. Once we complete that we
# will quickly finish the levels portion, and then add collectibles and possible a save point. The game is nearly
# complete and should be done by this Sunday (December 2).
